I'm trying to create an account for Damon Leong. I want to secure my home so that he won't be able to see the things inside. Setting chmod of my home die to 750 seems feasible. However an unwanted consequence is that apache's www-data gets kicked out together.

I need to somehow allow apache to access the folder from a group point of view.

Done. I just need to add www-data to jowos group.

PS. To check the groups a user belongs to, use the id command

However, it doesn't work. There's seems something wrong.

I notice that I have two sites with different ways of specifying the directory. For my CITutorial site, I simply created a soft symlink to my ~/git/CITutorial. For my CIBonfireTutorial site, I setÂ the DocumentRoot directory to ~/git/CIBonfireTutorial. Of course now that I have disabled global read permission to my home dir, access attempts from the user www-data will surely fail. In the first case where the softlink basically does a "redirect" into my home dir, the redirected access will still depend on the permission of the home dir. The second case's failure worth no explanation.

The next thing I want to try is mount the CITutorial node directly under var/www/. Mount works differently as symlink. Instead of pinning a treasure map that redirects visitors it simply open a back door into the backyard. Presumably it should bypass the permission of my home dir.

Success. CITutorial is online again. Now I can use this second method to manage the damon user.

Then I suddenly remembered that directories should always leave the execution bit on. I turned back to the /home dir and chmod my home dir to 0751\. Success, now my CIBonfire is back online again.

Conclusion: I'll set my home dir to 0751 to limit any global access.
