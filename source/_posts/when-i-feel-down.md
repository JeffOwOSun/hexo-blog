From time to time pressures from school and life just crowd in on me. All of a sudden things seem to go wrong and no lead could be figured out.

I hoped, at least once upon the time, that someone could peer into my heart and help me solve the problem. That person must know what I think, and even more, he/she should have greater heart and richer experiences over me so as to know how to solve my problem.

The ideal situation where my problems could be solved, I reckon, is that some hidden facts are dug out, forcing me to challenge my sticking to the state of desperation. Hey, you see, things are not so bad. Then why are you still wandering?

Unfortunately, that kind of thing seldom happens. Most of the time, I could only get stuck in the middle without a clue and feel overwhelmed by the flood of tension.

Now, now, I understand that. No one else could "solve" my problem.

Everybody is not able to "solve" someone else's problem.

By "solve" I mean, bring up a solution that takes into consideration all the apparent and latent conditions and lay a reasonable and comfortable set of measures so that by following them things could get dealt with presumably.

However, I reckon, I'm not craving for a solution. I'm craving for some belief, that soothes my nerves and set me out tackling the troubles.

A token, and I'm brave enough to advance my steps. I'm ultimately the one who solve the problem.

Just so simple. That's how people work, I guess.
