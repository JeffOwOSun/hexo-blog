Do not try to condescend. You are not saving anyone.

You are not trying to tell her that she is not correct in doing something. You don't even know for sure what is correct or wrong. Above that, you should respect her choice. If she blames herself, don't deny her self denial. If you have a better way, just show her in action. If not, better keep quiet and side with her. That's the best you can do.

Do not try to condescend. You are not saving anyone. You look up to.
